Trend Analysis:
# Annual Trend Analysis
Here we will be focusing on the spike that occurred in 2018 and how it affects the remaining years. In this case, we will assume that the business was performing at its normal pace as at 2017, before the spike. After careful research, I found out that the spike in 2018 was as a result of diversification. From previously selling to only Germany, the business extended its reach to Poland, leading to a general increase in their business performance. The business with Poland could not survive beyond 2018 and as a result, it led to a massive fall in the overall performance of the business in 2019. It got worse in 2020, probably due to the shocks from the periods between 2018 and 2019, that made them to lose some customers even in 

Germany.
As at 2017;
•	Total sales: $2.7bn
•	Quantity: 7m
•	Customers: 56k
As at 2018;
•	Total sales: 3.51bn
•	Quantity: 8m
•	Customers: 94k
As at 2019;
•	Total sales: 2.93bn
•	Quantity: 7m
•	Customers: 52k
As at 2020;
•	Total sales: 2.66bn
•	Quantity: 7m
•	Customers: 51k
Note: about 4k customers from Germany were lost as at 2020, compared to the number of customers in 2017.

# Monthly Sales Analysis
•	Lowest sales occurred in January (₦0.67bn), followed by a sharp recovery in February (₦0.97bn).
•	Peak sales were achieved in March (₦1.11bn) and September (₦1.19bn).
•	A notable dip occurred in April (₦0.80bn).

Note: Sales performance fluctuates, showing inconsistency in demand or execution, which requires smoothing through better demand forecasting and sales campaigns.

# Conclusion:
The business shows strong potential to thrive in other countries but suffers from inconsistency and lack of stability in a new environment.


# Recommendations

1.	Stabilize Monthly Sales: Address sharp fluctuations by aligning marketing efforts and promotional campaigns with seasonal demand trends.
2.	Rebuild customer/consumer confidence in Germany, while seeking for a lasting trade-deals in Poland and other targeted countries.
